### General Notes
Assumes this is on a fresh install of Yosemite. If you already have an environment setup, dont run the init.sh script, rather comb through this and cherry pick.

Make sure your bash scripts have had `chmod +x` ran on them; e.g. `chmod +x script.sh`, making the file executable by everyone.
